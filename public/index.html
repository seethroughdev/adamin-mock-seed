        <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>I'm applying for your Web Application Developer position.  Please see&nbsp;<a href="https://adamin.meteor.com/">my full resume</a>.</p>
        <p>Beyond being a fan of SurveyMonkey, I truly love building mockups.</p>
        <p>I enjoy architecting OOCSS structures, creating re-usable modules, learning new best practices, and writing custom SASS functions.  In short, I am a mockup geek.</p>
        <p>I've posted several tools I created to do mockups on my<a href="https://github.com/pensive612">&nbsp;Github account</a>. Including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/pensive612/adamin-mock-seed">adamin-mock-seed</a>- a simple mockup structure I set up for new projects.  It includes fully dynamic template loading with Jade.  And my preferred CSS structure which is similar to SMACSS, using Sass.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/pensive612/Adamin-Clone">adamin-clone</a>- one of the plugins I use the most.  I wasn't able to find a good solution for quickly cloning nested elements in jQuery, so I built a plugin that works perfect for me.  I built it with TDD using Qunit and Grunt.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/pensive612/angular-seed">adamin-mock-seed</a>- I customized a version of Angular seed that utilized SASS, HAML and CoffeeScript for creating quick Angular mockups.  However, after Yeoman was released, this idea was quickly abandoned ;)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There's a lot more stuff I'm interested in doing, and I'd be excited for an opportunity to discuss your needs and see if I could help be a part of it.</p>
        <p>I am currently in Los Angeles, but my family and I have been discussing relocating up north for quite a while.</p>
        <p>Thanks in advance,</p>
        <p>Adam Lichtenstein</p>
